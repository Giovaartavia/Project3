2 player card game for iOS. Specifically iPhone Plus models for now.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get this code up and running on your mac!

Step 1: In Terminal, use the command: git clone https://github.com/Giovaartavia/Project3.git

Step 2: Open the Project3 folder in Xcode

Step 3: You can change the compile destination to a simulator or your phone.

In the future, we might try to get the app on the App Store so you can directly download it to your phone from there.

## Documentation

To generate our code documentation, we used the Quick Help Pane in Xcode 8. While the Project is open in the Xcode, you may either search through the documentation or click on a function and have all the information appear in the Quick Help Pane.
